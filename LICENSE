Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal
------------------------------------

Statement of Purpose

The laws of every jurisdiction in the world recognize a diversity of rights, 
including copyright and other rights. Those rights restrict a user’s ability to 
freely use a work for various purposes. Some of those rights are inherent to the 
creator; others are acquired by contract, statute, or otherwise.

For example, copyright law grants authors and creators of original works the 
exclusive right to control certain uses of their works, such as the right to 
reproduce, distribute, and display their works. The creator may also have rights 
that restrict the commercial exploitation of a work, or the right to control 
modifications to the work.

Recognizing the desire of creators to waive all of those rights, and to place 
their works into the public domain, where the works may be freely used, 
Creative Commons has prepared this Public Domain Dedication.
